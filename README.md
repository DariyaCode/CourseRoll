# CourseRoll
The App includes many special proposals about IT courses. In this project, I practiced my ability to work with SwiftUI. This app contains the news, search, notifications and course library screens. Fashionable and attractive UI, smooth animations. 

In the app itself, I used the technologies that I'm currently learning. I try not to repeat myself, and in each new application, even with the same functionality, I try to develop them differently.
